          Grace Brewster Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992)
          was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States
          Navy rear admiral. A pioneer of computer programming, she was the
          first to propose the theory of machine-independent programming
          languages, leading to the development of the FLOW-MATIC language and
          COBOL. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 as part of the
          Harvard Mark I team, later contributing to the development of the
          UNIVAC I computer and managing the creation of early COBOL compilers.
          She advocated for simplified programming with an English-based syntax
          and played a significant role in the CODASYL consortium, which created
          COBOL. Hopper's impact on computing was profound, earning her numerous
          honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. Her
          legacy includes the USS Hopper destroyer, the Cray XE6 supercomputer
          "Hopper," and the Nvidia "Grace Hopper" superchip.

            Grace Brewster Murray was born in New York City, the eldest of three
            children to Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne. Her
            parents, of Scottish and Dutch descent, were active members of the
            West End Collegiate Church. Grace displayed a lifelong curiosity
            from a young age. At seven, she began dismantling alarm clocks to
            understand their workings, a habit that showcased her early penchant
            for understanding technology. Later in life, she kept a
            backward-running clock to challenge conventional thinking, stating,
            "Humans are allergic to change."

            For her education, Grace attended the Hartridge School in
            Plainfield, New Jersey, and later applied to Vassar College at the
            age of 16. Initially rejected due to low Latin scores, she was
            admitted the following year. In 1928, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa
            from Vassar with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics.
            Grace continued her academic journey at Yale University, earning her
            master's degree in 1930 and completing her Ph.D. in mathematics in
            1934. Her dissertation, "New Types of Irreducibility Criteria,"
            marked the beginning of her significant contributions to the field.
            She joined the faculty at Vassar in 1931, where she eventually
            became an associate professor by 1941, laying the groundwork for her
            groundbreaking work in computer science and programming later in
            life.

            Grace Hopper's career was shaped by her determination and pioneering
            spirit, beginning with her entry into the United States Navy Reserve
            during World War II. Despite initial setbacks, including age and
            weight requirements, Hopper excelled at the Naval Reserve
            Midshipmen's School and graduated top of her class in 1944. Assigned
            to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University,
            she collaborated closely with Howard H. Aiken on the Mark I
            computer, where they co-authored influential papers that laid the
            foundation for modern computing. Hopper's early work on the Mark I
            marked her as a trailblazer in the emerging field of computer
            science, showcasing her ability to bridge theoretical mathematics
            with practical applications.

            Post-war, Hopper joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation in
            1949, becoming a senior mathematician. Her visionary ideas led her
            to advocate for a programming language based on English words, which
            eventually materialized in the form of COBOL. Despite initial
            skepticism, she persevered, developing the A-0 compiler and later
            playing a key role in the development of COBOL through her work with
            the CODASYL committee in 1959. Her dedication to creating a more
            user-friendly programming language revolutionized data processing,
            making it accessible to a wider range of users beyond mathematicians
            and engineers.

            Appointed as the director of automatic programming at Eckert–Mauchly
            in 1954, Hopper oversaw the development of early programming
            languages like MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC. Her leadership and
            contributions to COBOL revolutionized data processing, making
            programming more accessible and paving the way for widespread
            adoption in business applications. Throughout her career, Hopper
            continued to push for computing standards and advancements in
            networked computing, leaving an enduring legacy in the field of
            computer science.

            Grace Hopper's post-military career was as illustrious as her
            service. Retiring from the Naval Reserve as a commander in 1966, she
            was recalled to active duty in 1967 and again in 1972, where she
            eventually attained the rank of captain in 1973 under Admiral Elmo
            R. Zumwalt Jr. Her exceptional contributions were further recognized
            when, in December 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed her to the
            rank of commodore on the retired list, later redesignated as rear
            admiral (lower half). Hopper continued to serve beyond the usual
            retirement age, receiving special approval from Congress until her
            final retirement on August 14, 1986.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her retirement ceremony, held aboard the USS Constitution in Boston,
            marked a remarkable milestone: she was the oldest serving member of
            the Navy at 79 years, eight months, and five days. At this event,
            she was honored with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the
            highest non-combat award from the Department of Defense. Admiral
            Hopper's legacy extends beyond.

            Following her retirement from the Navy, Grace Hopper joined Digital
            Equipment Corporation (DEC) as a senior consultant. Initially
            offered a position by Rita Yavinsky, she insisted on a formal
            interview process. In a jest, she proposed a position available on
            alternating Thursdays at their computing museum in exchange for a
            generous salary and unlimited expense account. Instead, she was
            hired as a full-time Principal Corporate Consulting Engineer,
            equivalent to a senior vice president. In this role, Hopper
            represented DEC at industry forums and served on various committees.
          </p>
          <p>
            She remained with DEC until her passing at age 85 in 1992, primarily
            serving as a goodwill ambassador. Despite no longer being in the
            military, she wore her Navy uniform to lectures, receiving standing
            ovations at Digital's engineering facilities. In 2016, she was
            posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her
            profound contributions to computer science and her dedication to
            mentoring young talent, which she considered one of her greatest
            achievements alongside pioneering the compiler.
